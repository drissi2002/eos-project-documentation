# EOS-Documentation
This repository will serve as the central source for all documentation related to my PFE subject. It will concentrate on the tools that will be utilized, such as engines, stacks, databases, CI/CD, etc. I will regularly create a README file to detail each step of my progress, document my research, and maintain a record for later use in writing my final report for my supervisor
